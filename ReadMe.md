# Seafood Restaurant Website

Welcome to the Seafood Restaurant Website! This web application allows users to view the menu and explore a wide variety of delicious seafood dishes. The project is built with HTML, CSS, jquery, javascript for the front end and node.js and express.js for the backend showcasing a modern, interactive design.

__Note:__
This small project doesn't use a database; instead, all the restaurant dish data is stored in a file.

## How to Run the Project
1. run the command `git clone https://github.com/MalakGdaea/seafood-restaurant.git`
2. cd seafood-restaurant
2. run the command `npm start`
3. the website will be available at `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
